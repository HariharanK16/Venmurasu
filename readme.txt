The code displays and stores the final top 10 words along with their length.

Algorithm:
	1. Code is given with an URL initially.
	2. The whole HTML page source code is scrapped and stored in a list.
	3. From the whole HTML list, story paras which are inside div class are taken.
	4. The paras are separated  into individual words and stored in a list.
	5. Finally the list is sorted in decending order.
	6. Keeping only the top 10 words remaining words are deleted.
	7. Later,the list is stored in the text file.

The final top 10 longest words will be stored in "data.txt" file.

Sorry for the late submission sir.
We finished our venmurasu code long back but due to some reasons we didn't submit before.
One of the reason is we didn't run our code for all the 
25000 pages,since our laptop can't withstand such a heavy load.
We tested our code for 1000 pages and removed all the bugs to the best that we could
do.

We changed our code in such a way to work with new UI of venmurasu website.
